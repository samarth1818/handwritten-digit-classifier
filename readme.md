The purpose of this project is to understand the properties of memory based classifier, KNN.

* The Driver.py module contains code to plot graph of test error produced by KNN classifier on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset for different values of K.

* The Classifier.py module contains implementation of the KNN algorithm
